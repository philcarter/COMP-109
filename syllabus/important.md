## Students with Disabilities
Disability Services and Programs for Students (DSPS) coordinates all academic accommodations for students with documented disabilities at Santa Barbara City College. If you have or think you might have a disability that impacts your educational experience in this class, contact DSPS to determine your eligibility for accommodations.

If you have already registered with DSPS, please submit your accommodation requests via the‘DSPS Online Services Student Portal’ as soon as possible. This needs to be done each semester. If you have any questions or concerns about your accommodations, please make an appointment with a DSPS Counselor.

Complete this process in a timely manner to allow adequate time to provide accommodations.

DSPS is located in the Student Services (SS) Building, Room  160. 
Contact the DSPS office (805-965-0581 ext. 2364; email: [dspshelp@sbcc.edu](mailto:dspshelp@sbcc.edu) 

## Academic Honesty

-   Submitting someone else’s files as your own
-   Submitting either your assignments or another student’s files from a previous semester
-   Helping someone or receiving help on an exam
-   Getting someone else to take your exams

**What happens if you cheat?**
Both you and the other students involved will receive an F on the assignment, exam, and/or for the entire course and your name will be sent to the Dean for Academic Discipline.
