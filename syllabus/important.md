##Academic Honesty
You are expected to complete your own assignments and exams. If you are caught cheating, both you and the other students involved will receive an F.

**What do we mean by “cheating?”**

-   Working with another student to complete assignments or exams
-   Submitting someone else’s files as your own
-   Submitting either your assignments or another student’s files from a previous semester
-   Helping someone or receiving help on an exam
-   Getting someone else to take your exams

**What happens if you cheat?**
Both you and the other students involved will receive an F on the assignment, exam, and/or for the entire course and your name will be sent to the Dean for Academic Discipline.

##Appropriate Behavior
Please consider our online classroom in Canvas as public and professional space.

All involved, the instructor, the online instructional aide and you, the student, are expected to conduct themselves in their dealings with each other with respect, civility and the highest standards of professionalism.

This applies not only to any verbal or direct communication but also to all forms of your “digital” presence in the class.

“Our goal is to ensure a safe, non-harrassing learning environment for everyone in the class.”
